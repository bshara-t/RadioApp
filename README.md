An internet radio app for Android , made for a March/2019 Hackathon competition.

---------------------------

This app has bilingual UIs (English & Hebrew) , although the tracklist is solely in Hebrew.
It has a nav-bar with four screens {fragments} : broadcasts list / comments / favorites / search.
The backend uses cloudant service for DB to store broadcast data (including urls, info, and comments data).
The broadcast files themselves are hosted on repo-cyber servers. 

---------------------------

the submitted version could be found in the branch:  "hachathon-submitted-version" , which is "frozen" (i.e. no more updates) to keep record of what was done.

This branch (the ongoing) branch is updated continuously, with bug-fixes and improvements
