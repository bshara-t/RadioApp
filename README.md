# Radio Etzion App

An internet radio app for Android , made for a March/2019 Hackathon competition.
The competition was about organizing internet radio broadcasts for a special education school.
It was sponsored by IBM, repo-cyber and Beit-Ekstein (the organization for which the school belongs).

Radio broadcasts can be found on: https://www.mixcloud.com/Radio_Etzion2/

---------------------------

This app has bilingual UIs (English & Hebrew) , although the tracklist is solely in Hebrew.

It has a nav-bar with four screens {fragments} : broadcasts list / comments / favorites / search.

The backend uses cloudant service for DB to store broadcast data (including urls, info, and comments data).

The broadcast files themselves are hosted on repo-cyber servers. 

---------------------------

The submitted version could be found in the branch:  "hachathon-submitted-version" , which is "frozen" (i.e. no more updates) to keep record of what was done.

This branch (ongoing) is updated continuously, with bug-fixes and improvements
